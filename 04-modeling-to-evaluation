## Modeling
- How can we visualize our datasets to help us find answers to the question we were asked
- We build data models and use training sets and testing sets
- The success of the modeling largely depends of understanding of the question, the analytical and methods approach used
- For building the data model, we need to compile, prepare and model

### Case Study
- Using decision tree to classify readmission of a patient
- In the example while the Overall accuracy represents highest accuracy, it only represents 45% of the Yes answers
- To tune the model, we need to make adjustment to the Relative Cost Y:N which is the ration of Yes to No answers
- Type 1 Eror aka False Positive
- Type 2 Error aka False Negative
- Sensitivity is the Accuracy in respect to Yes answers
- Specificity is the Accuracy in respect to No answers

## Evaluation
- Have we indeed answer the question using the designed model or we need to calibrate the model further
- Involves feedback loop to determine relevance and fitness of the model
