## Deployment
- Involves ensuring all stakeholders are aware of the solution
- Deployment is the ultimate test in validating the model is useful
- Model results needs to be traslated so the receiving stakeholders are well trained how to use and respond
- Sufficient monitor must be deployed to ensure working feedback back loop

## Feedback 
- Drives model refinement and peformance tuning
- The ultimate test of model is when its put into real time use in the field
- Feedback process
  - Define the review process
  - Refine the model
  - Redeploy the improved model

## Story Telling
- Use clear, concise and compelling story to support the case
- Support datasets with visuals and back story behind it
- Keep balance between complexity and simlicity of the story
- Use story to convey your message, so people remember and establish connection
