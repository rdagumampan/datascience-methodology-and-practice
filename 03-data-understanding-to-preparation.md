## Data Understanding
#### Understanding the data
- Use of descriptive statistics to understand data
- Univariate statistics
- Statistics such as mean, median, min, max, stddev
- Pairwise correlations, indicative of relationships worth further study, adjustments for potential confounding variables
- Histograms, graph that shows the frequency of numerical data using rectangles

### Look at data quality
- Missing values
- Invalid values
- Duplicate values
- Formatting issues

### Run an iterative process
- Collect data and understand in multiple iterations

## Data Preparation
- Cleansing data,
- Takes most time ~70-90% in data science project
- Analogy: it takes more time to chop onions but to cook a recipe the onion needs to be chopped
- Data understanding: What does it mean to "prepare" and "clean" the data?
- Data preparation: What are ways in which data is prepared?
- Feature engineering is the use of domain knowledge and expertise to enable machine learning process
- Feature engineering works like a funnel to identify and filter the best candidate variables to use in ML
- Randomly groups data can be divided into training set and testing set

## Summary
- Data understanding covers tasks such as building the dataset and ensuring fitness of it we are trying to answer
- In Data Undestanding stage, data scientists may use various analytic approach such as descriptive statistics, predicitive statistics or both
