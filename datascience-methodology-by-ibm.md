### Data Science Methodology
Data Science Methodology guides data scientists in solving complex problems with data. This includes forms of data colleciton, strategies for measurement and methods for comparison.

#### Case Study


#### Ten Stages in Data Science
- Business understanding
- Analytic approach
- Data requirements
- Data collection
- Data understanding
- Data preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment
- Feedback

#### Notes
- Get stakeholder buyin and support

#### Stage 1: Business Understanding
- Define: Prepare clearly defined set of questions to help identify the right analytic approach
- Understand: Understand the goal of the sponsor
- Objectives: Organize set of clear objectives
- Engagement: Stakeholder engagement is important in capturing the requirements and clarify the questions
- what is the problem are we trying to solve?
- Define goals and objectives
- Kickoff the project with
- What is expected out of sponsor
  - Set the project direction
  - Remain engaged and provide guidance
  - Ensure needed support should need arise

#### Stage 2:  Analytic Approach
- Steps to run analytical approach
  - Identify the patterns
  - Choose an analytical approach
  - Apply machine learning
- Available patterns to address the questions
  - Descriptive (Current status)
    - What is the current situation?
  - Diagnostic (Statistical Analysis)
    - What happened?
    - Why is this happening?
  - Predictive (Forecasting)
    -  What if the trends continue?
    -  What will happen next?
  - Prescriptive (Reccommendations)
    - How do we solve it? 
- 
##### Model types
- Use Descriptive Model to show relationshops
- Use Predicitive Model to show probabilities of an action
- Use Classification Model to capture yes/no answers

##### Machine Learning
- Learn without being programmed
- Can identify relationships and trends in data
- Uses clustering association

##### Decision Tree Classification
- A classification outcome is certain
- A decision path is well represented by describing the conditions leading to high risk
- Simple to understand and implement
